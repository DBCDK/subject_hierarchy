## Documentation ##
Subject hierarchy consists of 3 directories:
- full
- singles
- xsd

The directory 'full' has the subjects ordered in a hierarchy and both in a
latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) and a utf-8 encoded version. The directory named 'singles'
has the subjects as a list of separate entities and likewise in a latin-1 and a
utf-8 encoded version. Finally the 'xsd' directory contains two XSD describing
the full and the singles formats.
